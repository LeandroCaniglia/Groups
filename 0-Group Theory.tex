\section*{Theorem 1a}
Let $G$ be a finite group, $B \normal G$ an abelian subgroup, $B \normal A \normal G$, $A$ a soluble subgroup, $A \normal H \leq G$, $(|A|,[G:H])=1$, $H = A \cdot K$, $A \cap K = E$, $K \leq H$. Furthermore, suppose $[K,A] \leq B$ and $(KB)^g \cap H \leq KB$ for all $g \in G$. Then there exists $L \leq G$ such that $L\cdot A = G$ and $L \cap A = E$.


\section*{Theorem Ib}
Assumptions as in Theorem Ia. Additionally: For any two complements of $A$ in $H$ that are conjugate under $H$, they are already conjugate under $B$. Then the following holds:


If $G$ is a finite group, $S \leq G$, and $A < G$, then there are two crucial "complementary" questions:

1. Is there a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $N \cdot S = G$, $N \cap S = \emptyset$, or more precisely: Determine the smallest normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ with $N \cdot S = G$.
2. For $A < G$, determine the smallest subgroup $H$ of $G$ with $AH = G$. Or equivalently: Is there a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $AH = G$ and $A \cap H = \emptyset$.

A typical example of a theorem for question 1 is a theorem by Burnside: If $S$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ lying in the center of its normalizer, then there exists $N \leq G$, $N \cdot S = G$, $N \cap S = \emptyset$.

A typical example of a theorem for question 2 is a theorem by Zassenhaus: If $(|A|, [G:A]) = 1$, then there exists $H \leq G$ with $AH = G$ and $A \cap H = \emptyset$.

An important tool for answering questions of type 1 is the Transfer Theory: Let $H \leq G$, $H < o < H$, $H/H_0$ abelian, $\Phi$ a representative system of $G/H$, then the mapping
